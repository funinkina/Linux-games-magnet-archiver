# Save Magnet links of native linux games
This python script scrapes the site [FreeLinuxPCGames](https://freelinuxpcgames.com), that has all the magnet links for the games.

## How to use?
1. Clone the repository.
    - `git clone <url>`
2. Create a new virtual environment if you don't have one.
    - Windows:
      ` python -m venv venv`
    - Mac/Linux:
        `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment.
    - Windows:
        `venv\Scripts\activate`
    - Mac/Linux:
        `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the requirements.
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### And that's it, after the script completes, you will have a file named `game_details.csv` with all the relevant data.
